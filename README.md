# Todo list app in HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
You can add a task by writing the name of the task in the field.
Click ADD to add the task to the list.
The task will be added with the yellow background.
When you finish the task click on it and the background will become green + the text will get the decoration: line-through.
If you want to delete the task from the list just double click on it.
That's it for now, I will add more stuff as soon as I learn how.
